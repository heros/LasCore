InfinityCore login is a bit different. Authserver is designed to allow any client version from 1.12.0 to 5.2.0 (currently)

The account creation is also a little different.
Syntax: .account create $account $password $email

Here is the basics of how Authserver does authentication:

When you log in, Authserver checks your client version. If version is 15595 or older, it will require username\pass to log in. 
There is a field called "last_build" in account table. It stores the last known client version. If current client version is same as what is stored in last_build, then it just authenticates.
If it is different, Authserver will recalculate v and s fields.

If client version is greater than 15595 then you use email\pass. the process is the same. The only difference now between greater or less than 15595 is the pass field

for 15595 or older, it uses sha_pass_hash. For newer than 15595 then it uses sha_email_pass_hash. v and s are calculated using these fields, based on last_build field.

last_build field is populated with data first time you log in, and only changes if you have a different client version than the last time you logged in.
